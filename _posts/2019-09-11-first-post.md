An upcoming musician that I love to listen to is Chelsea Cutler. She has a unique voice, unlike anything I've heard before. She often collaborates with fellow indie pop musician, Jeremy Zucker, and the pair recently released a collaborative EP together, titled 'brent'.
My top 3 Chelsea Cutler songs are:
1. Mess
2. Deserve This
3. Evil
